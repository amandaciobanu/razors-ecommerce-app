    "All DE razor blades are a standardised size and shape and will therefore fit any double edge safety razor you own. Razor blade preference is very personal to each invidual and a period of trial and error usually helps to determine which band is best suited to your skin.\n" +

        "All razor blades go through an extensive manufacturing process, starting off as long strips of stainless steel that go through several processes in order to create the fine, sharp blades that are easy and enjoyable to shave with. Once crafted, all blades go through strict quality control tests to ensure they are ideal for consumer use.",
